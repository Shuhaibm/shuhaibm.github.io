Hi 👋! I am a PhD Student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tur](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GMcL_9kAAAAJ).

I am interested in builing agents that know how to interact with users. My current work explores:
- **Multi-turn interactions**: Loading... ⌛️.
- **Multi-session interactions:** We introduced the first benchmark for multi-session collaboration, and demonstrated that equipping agents with memory can improve collaboration quality over time (through both simulated experiments and human studies) [[tweet]](https://x.com/ShuhaibMehri/status/2009307148644438517) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02702).
- **Reliable and realistic user simulation:** We identified that user simulators struggle to consistently adhere to their assigned goals throughout multi-turn interactions, and introduced user goal state tracking to address this [[tweet]](https://x.com/ShuhaibMehri/status/1950232383380430902) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20152).

Before starting my PhD, I earned my BSc in Honours Computer Science from the University of British Columbia. I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Vered Shwartz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bbe4ResAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Giuseppe Carenini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HNNL22kAAAAJ&hl=en). I also interned at Amazon (x3), iClinic Systems, and Clir Renewables.
